# Time-serie-forecasting
The main idea of the model is to decompose the time series into 3 parts(seasonality, residue, trend), extrapolate these 3 parts and then combine it's to forecast.

Input/output data is set of time series on first sheet in excel file. Primary key for each time serie is in column "target".
